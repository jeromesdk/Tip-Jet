# Impact of global warming on Tip-Jets

This project aims to study the impact of global warming on Tip-Jets. 
It studies more particularly the evolution of Tip-Jet's intensity, 
frequency and seasonality according to two scenarios from CMIP6. 
Those scenarios reflect various levels of economic development and 
reliance on fossil fuels. SSP585 (corresponding to a forcing of 
8.5 W/m² by 2100) represents a high-emission path with fast economic
growth and heavy fossil fuel use, while SSP126 (corresponding to a
forcing of 2.6 W/m² by 2100) represents a sustainable, low-emission 
trajectory.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download the content of the Git repository [Tip-Jet](https://github.com/jeromesdk/Tip-Jet).

```bash git clone https://github.com/jeromesdk/Tip-Jet.git```

2. Use Google Colab to run the code. Add the `tip_jet_detection.py` file to your Colab environment.

3. Notebooks can be opened and executed independently in Colab.
